### What it does
Initializes and configures test environment with the following:
- [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) for writing tests and transpiling `.ts` imports
- [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) for running tests
- [sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon) for mocking/stubbing functions
- [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) for assertions w/
  - [sinon-chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai)
  - [chai-dom](https://github.com/nathanboktae/chai-dom)
- [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) for a browser-esque environment
#### ‚ú® Bonus features
- üòè No webpack
- üöÄ Tracks dependencies in watch mode and only re-runs tests that are affected
- üì¶ Limited support for loading `.vue` files (only `<template>` and `<script lang="ts">` are currently supported

### How it does it
Provides a basic cli for running tests borrowing many of the ideas from [@tomazzaman](https://github.com/tomazzaman)'s excellent article ‚Äú[How to get fast unit tests with(out) Webpack](https://medium.com/@TomazZaman/how-to-get-fast-unit-tests-with-out-webpack-793c408a076f)‚Äù

### Using it in your projects
#### Install it
```
yarn add @snaptopixel/testify
```

#### Add run script(s) to `package.json`
##### Single test run  
> `-t` is shorthand for `--test-glob`
```json
{
  "test": "testify -t tests/**/*.spec.ts"
}
```
##### Watch mode (re-run tests when files are changed)
```json
{
  "test:watch": "testify -t packages/**/*.spec.ts -w"
}
```
##### Single test run w/coverage
> Install [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and prepend it to your script before `testify`. Check nyc's README for configuration options
```js
{
  "test": "nyc testify -t tests/**/*.spec.ts"
}
```

### Customizing the test environment
You can require any number of .js files using the `-r` argument like so:
```js
{
  "test": "testify -t tests/**/*.spec.ts -r some-file.js some-other-file.js"
}
```
These scripts will be required and executed in the node environment once jsdom has been initialized.  

This is useful if your scripts depend on global variables, for example:

```js
// In required js file
window.SomeGlobal = {
  someMethod: sinon.spy()
}

// In test file 'test.spec.ts'
describe('globals', () => {
  it('can access global', () => {
    window.SomeGlobal.someMethod('hey')
    expect(window.SomeGlobal.someMethod).calledWith('hey')
  })
})
```
